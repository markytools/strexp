    Computes attribution of the given neuron using deconvolution.
    Deconvolution computes the gradient of the target output with

    that the gradient of the ReLU input is simply computed taking ReLU of
    the output gradient, essentially only propagating non-negative gradients
    (without dependence on the sign of the ReLU input).

                        tensor as input, a single input tensor should be provided.

                        multiple input tensors are provided, the examples must
                        be aligned appropriately.
            neuron_selector (int, callable, or tuple of ints or slices):
                        Selector for neuron
                        in given layer for which attribution is desired.
                        Neuron selector can be provided as:

                        - a single integer, if the layer output is 2D. This integer
                          selects the appropriate neuron column in the layer input
                          or output

                          The elements of the tuple can be either integers or

                          If any of the tuple elements is a slice object, the
                          indexed output tensor is used for attribution. Note

                          neurons, and not the individual neurons independantly.

                          take the target layer as input (single tensor or tuple

                        requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                        which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                        can be provided. It must be either a single additional

                        Note that attributions are not computed with respect

                        compute the attributions with respect to the neuron input
                        or output. If `attribute_to_neuron_input` is set to True
                        then the attributions will be computed with respect to
                        neuron's inputs, otherwise it will be computed with respect
                        to neuron's outputs.
                        Note that currently it is assumed that either the input
                        or the output of internal neuron, depending on whether we
                        attribute to the input or output, is a single tensor.
                        Support for multiple tensors will be added later.
                        Default: False
        Returns:
            *tensor* or tuple of *tensors* of **attributions**:
            - **attributions** (*tensor* or tuple of *tensors*):
                        Deconvolution attribution of
                        particular neuron with respect to each input feature.
                        Attributions will always be the same size as the provided
                        inputs, with each value providing the attribution of the
                        corresponding input index.
                        If a single tensor is provided as inputs, a single tensor is
                        returned. If a tuple is provided for inputs, a tuple of
                        corresponding sized tensors is returned.
