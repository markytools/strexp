    Implements gradient SHAP for a neuron in a hidden layer based on the
    implementation from SHAP's primary author. For reference, please, view:

    A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions
    http://papers.nips.cc/paper\
    7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions

    GradientShap approximates SHAP values by computing the expectations of
    gradients by randomly sampling from the distribution of baselines/references.
    It adds white noise to each input sample `n_samples` times, selects a
    random baseline from baselines' distribution and a random point along the
    path between the baseline and the input, and computes the gradient of the
    neuron with index `neuron_selector` with respect to those selected random
    points. The final SHAP values represent the expected values of
    `gradients * (inputs - baselines)`.

    GradientShap makes an assumption that the input features are independent
    and that the explanation model is linear, meaning that the explanations
    are modeled through the additive composition of feature effects.
    Under those assumptions, SHAP value can be approximated as the expectation
    of gradients that are computed for randomly generated `n_samples` input
    samples after adding gaussian noise `n_samples` times to each input for
    different baselines/references.

    In some sense it can be viewed as an approximation of integrated gradients
    by computing the expectations of gradients for different baselines.

    Current implementation uses Smoothgrad from `NoiseTunnel` in order to
    randomly draw samples from the distribution of baselines, add noise to input
    samples and compute the expectation (smoothgrad).

            forward_func (callable):  The forward function of the model or any
                        modification of it
            layer (torch.nn.Module): Layer for which neuron attributions are computed.
                        The output size of the attribute method matches the
                        dimensions of the inputs or ouputs of the neuron with
                        index `neuron_selector` in this layer, depending on whether
                        we attribute to the inputs or outputs of the neuron.
                        Currently, it is assumed that the inputs or the outputs
                        of the neurons in this layer, depending on which one is
                        used for attribution, can only be a single tensor.
            device_ids (list(int)): Device ID list, necessary only if forward_func
                        applies a DataParallel model. This allows reconstruction of
                        intermediate outputs from batched results across devices.
                        If forward_func is given as the DataParallel model itself,
                        then it is not necessary to provide this argument.
            multiply_by_inputs (bool, optional): Indicates whether to factor
                        model inputs' multiplier in the final attribution scores.
                        In the literature this is also known as local vs global
                        attribution. If inputs' multiplier isn't factored in
                        then that type of attribution method is also called local
                        attribution. If it is, then that type of attribution
                        method is called global.

                        sensitivity scores for scaled inputs are

        Args:

            inputs (tensor or tuple of tensors):  Input for which SHAP attribution
                        values are computed. If `forward_func` takes a single
                        tensor as input, a single input tensor should be provided.
                        If `forward_func` takes multiple tensors as input, a tuple
                        of the input tensors should be provided. It is assumed
                        that for all given input tensors, dimension 0 corresponds
                        to the number of examples, and if multiple input tensors
                        are provided, the examples must be aligned appropriately.
            neuron_selector (int, callable, or tuple of ints or slices):
                        Selector for neuron
                        in given layer for which attribution is desired.
                        Neuron selector can be provided as:

                        - a single integer, if the layer output is 2D. This integer
                          selects the appropriate neuron column in the layer input
                          or output

                        - a tuple of integers or slice objects. Length of this
                          tuple must be one less than the number of dimensions
                          in the input / output of the given layer (since
                          dimension 0 corresponds to number of examples).
                          The elements of the tuple can be either integers or
                          slice objects (slice object allows indexing a
                          range of neurons rather individual ones).

                          If any of the tuple elements is a slice object, the
                          indexed output tensor is used for attribution. Note
                          that specifying a slice of a tensor would amount to
                          computing the attribution of the sum of the specified
                          neurons, and not the individual neurons independantly.

                        - a callable, which should
                          take the target layer as input (single tensor or tuple
                          if multiple tensors are in layer) and return a neuron or
                          aggregate of the layer's neurons for attribution.
                          For example, this function could return the
                          sum of the neurons in the layer or sum of neurons with
                          activations in a particular range. It is expected that
                          this function returns either a tensor with one element
                          or a 1D tensor with length equal to batch_size (one scalar
                          per input example)
            baselines (tensor, tuple of tensors, callable):
                        Baselines define the starting point from which expectation
                        is computed and can be provided as:

                        - a single tensor, if inputs is a single tensor, with
                          the first dimension equal to the number of examples
                          in the baselines' distribution. The remaining dimensions
                          must match with input tensor's dimension starting from
                          the second dimension.

                        - a tuple of tensors, if inputs is a tuple of tensors,
                          with the first dimension of any tensor inside the tuple
                          equal to the number of examples in the baseline's
                          distribution. The remaining dimensions must match
                          the dimensions of the corresponding input tensor
                          starting from the second dimension.

                        - callable function, optionally takes `inputs` as an
                          argument and either returns a single tensor
                          or a tuple of those.

                        It is recommended that the number of samples in the baselines'
                        tensors is larger than one.
            n_samples (int, optional):  The number of randomly generated examples
                        per sample in the input batch. Random examples are
                        generated by adding gaussian random noise to each sample.
                        Default: `5` if `n_samples` is not provided.
            stdevs    (float, or a tuple of floats optional): The standard deviation
                        of gaussian noise with zero mean that is added to each
                        input in the batch. If `stdevs` is a single float value
                        then that same value is used for all inputs. If it is
                        a tuple, then it must have the same length as the inputs
                        tuple. In this case, each stdev value in the stdevs tuple
                        corresponds to the input with the same index in the inputs
                        tuple.
                        Default: 0.0
            additional_forward_args (any, optional): If the forward function
                        requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                        which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                        can be provided. It can contain a tuple of ND tensors or
                        any arbitrary python type of any shape.
                        In case of the ND tensor the first dimension of the
                        tensor must correspond to the batch size. It will be
                        repeated for each `n_steps` for each randomly generated
                        input sample.
                        Note that the gradients are not computed with respect
                        to these arguments.
                        Default: None
            attribute_to_neuron_input (bool, optional): Indicates whether to
                        compute the attributions with respect to the neuron input
                        or output. If `attribute_to_neuron_input` is set to True
                        then the attributions will be computed with respect to
                        neuron's inputs, otherwise it will be computed with respect
                        to neuron's outputs.
                        Note that currently it is assumed that either the input
                        or the output of internal neuron, depending on whether we
                        attribute to the input or output, is a single tensor.
                        Support for multiple tensors will be added later.
                        Default: False

        Returns:
            **attributions** or 2-element tuple of **attributions**, **delta**:
            - **attributions** (*tensor* or tuple of *tensors*):
                        Attribution score computed based on GradientSHAP with respect
                        to each input feature. Attributions will always be
                        the same size as the provided inputs, with each value
                        providing the attribution of the corresponding input index.
                        If a single tensor is provided as inputs, a single tensor is
                        returned. If a tuple is provided for inputs, a tuple of
                        corresponding sized tensors is returned.
