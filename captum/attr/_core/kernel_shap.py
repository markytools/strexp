    Kernel SHAP is a method that uses the LIME framework to compute
    Shapley Values. Setting the loss function, weighting kernel and
    regularization terms appropriately in the LIME framework allows
    theoretically obtaining Shapley Values more efficiently than
    directly computing Shapley Values.

        This method attributes the output of the model with given target index
        (in case it is provided, otherwise it assumes that output is a
        scalar) to the inputs of the model using the approach described above,
        training an interpretable model based on KernelSHAP and returning a
        representation of the interpretable model.

        It is recommended to only provide a single example as input (tensors
        with first dimension or batch size = 1). This is because LIME / KernelShap
        is generally used for sample-based interpretability, training a separate
        interpretable model to explain a model's prediction on each individual example.

        A batch of inputs can also be provided as inputs, similar to
        other perturbation-based attribution methods. In this case, if forward_fn
        returns a scalar per example, attributions will be computed for each
        example independently, with a separate interpretable model trained for each
        example. Note that provided similarity and perturbation functions will be
        provided each example separately (first dimension = 1) in this case.
        If forward_fn returns a scalar per batch (e.g. loss), attributions will
        still be computed using a single interpretable model for the full batch.
        In this case, similarity and perturbation functions will be provided the
        same original input containing the full batch.

        The number of interpretable features is determined from the provided
        feature mask, or if none is provided, from the default feature mask,
        which considers each scalar input as a separate feature. It is
        generally recommended to provide a feature mask which groups features
        into a small number of interpretable features / components (e.g.
        superpixels in images).

        Args:

            inputs (tensor or tuple of tensors):  Input for which KernelShap
                        is computed. If forward_func takes a single
                        tensor as input, a single input tensor should be provided.
                        If forward_func takes multiple tensors as input, a tuple
                        of the input tensors should be provided. It is assumed
                        that for all given input tensors, dimension 0 corresponds
                        to the number of examples, and if multiple input tensors
                        are provided, the examples must be aligned appropriately.
            baselines (scalar, tensor, tuple of scalars or tensors, optional):
                        Baselines define the reference value which replaces each
                        feature when the corresponding interpretable feature
                        is set to 0.
                        Baselines can be provided as:

                        - a single tensor, if inputs is a single tensor, with
                          exactly the same dimensions as inputs or the first
                          dimension is one and the remaining dimensions match
                          with inputs.

                        - a single scalar, if inputs is a single tensor, which will
                          be broadcasted for each input value in input tensor.

                        - a tuple of tensors or scalars, the baseline corresponding
                          to each tensor in the inputs' tuple can be:

                          - either a tensor with matching dimensions to
                            corresponding tensor in the inputs' tuple
                            or the first dimension is one and the remaining
                            dimensions match with the corresponding
                            input tensor.

                          - or a scalar, corresponding to a tensor in the
                            inputs' tuple. This scalar value is broadcasted
                            for corresponding input tensor.
                        In the cases when `baselines` is not provided, we internally
                        use zero scalar corresponding to each input tensor.
                        Default: None
            target (int, tuple, tensor or list, optional):  Output indices for
                        which surrogate model is trained
                        (for classification cases,
                        this is usually the target class).
                        If the network returns a scalar value per example,
                        no target index is necessary.
                        For general 2D outputs, targets can be either:

                        - a single integer or a tensor containing a single
                          integer, which is applied to all input examples

                        - a list of integers or a 1D tensor, with length matching
                          the number of examples in inputs (dim 0). Each integer
                          is applied as the target for the corresponding example.

                        For outputs with > 2 dimensions, targets can be either:

                        - A single tuple, which contains #output_dims - 1
                          elements. This target index is applied to all examples.

                        - A list of tuples with length equal to the number of
                          examples in inputs (dim 0), and each tuple containing
                          #output_dims - 1 elements. Each tuple is applied as the
                          target for the corresponding example.

                        Default: None
            additional_forward_args (any, optional): If the forward function
                        requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                        which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                        can be provided. It must be either a single additional
                        argument of a Tensor or arbitrary (non-tuple) type or a
                        tuple containing multiple additional arguments including
                        tensors or any arbitrary python types. These arguments
                        are provided to forward_func in order following the
                        arguments in inputs.
                        For a tensor, the first dimension of the tensor must
                        correspond to the number of examples. It will be
                        repeated for each of `n_steps` along the integrated
                        path. For all other types, the given argument is used
                        for all forward evaluations.
                        Note that attributions are not computed with respect
                        to these arguments.
                        Default: None
            feature_mask (tensor or tuple of tensors, optional):
                        feature_mask defines a mask for the input, grouping
                        features which correspond to the same
                        interpretable feature. feature_mask
                        should contain the same number of tensors as inputs.
                        Each tensor should
                        be the same size as the corresponding input or
                        broadcastable to match the input tensor. Values across
                        all tensors should be integers in the range 0 to
                        num_interp_features - 1, and indices corresponding to the
                        same feature should have the same value.
                        Note that features are grouped across tensors
                        (unlike feature ablation and occlusion), so
                        if the same index is used in different tensors, those
                        features are still grouped and added simultaneously.
                        If None, then a feature mask is constructed which assigns
                        each scalar within a tensor as a separate feature.
                        Default: None
            n_samples (int, optional):  The number of samples of the original
                        model used to train the surrogate interpretable model.
                        Default: `50` if `n_samples` is not provided.
            perturbations_per_eval (int, optional): Allows multiple samples
                        to be processed simultaneously in one call to forward_fn.
                        Each forward pass will contain a maximum of
                        perturbations_per_eval * #examples samples.
                        For DataParallel models, each batch is split among the
                        available devices, so evaluations on each available
                        device contain at most
                        (perturbations_per_eval * #examples) / num_devices
                        samples.
                        If the forward function returns a single scalar per batch,
                        perturbations_per_eval must be set to 1.
                        Default: 1
            return_input_shape (bool, optional): Determines whether the returned
                        tensor(s) only contain the coefficients for each interp-
                        retable feature from the trained surrogate model, or
                        whether the returned attributions match the input shape.
                        When return_input_shape is True, the return type of attribute
                        matches the input shape, with each element containing the
                        coefficient of the corresponding interpretable feature.
                        All elements with the same value in the feature mask
                        will contain the same coefficient in the returned
                        attributions. If return_input_shape is False, a 1D
                        tensor is returned, containing only the coefficients
                        of the trained interpretable model, with length
                        num_interp_features.
            show_progress (bool, optional): Displays the progress of computation.
                        It will try to use tqdm if available for advanced features
                        (e.g. time estimation). Otherwise, it will fallback to
                        a simple output of progress.
                        Default: False

        Returns:
            *tensor* or tuple of *tensors* of **attributions**:
            - **attributions** (*tensor* or tuple of *tensors*):
                        The attributions with respect to each input feature.
                        If return_input_shape = True, attributions will be
                        the same size as the provided inputs, with each value
                        providing the coefficient of the corresponding
                        interpretale feature.
                        If return_input_shape is False, a 1D
                        tensor is returned, containing only the coefficients
                        of the trained interpreatable models, with length
                        num_interp_features.
