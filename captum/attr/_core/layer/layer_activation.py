        Args:

            inputs (tensor or tuple of tensors):  Input for which layer
                        activation is computed. If forward_func takes a single
                        tensor as input, a single input tensor should be provided.
                        If forward_func takes multiple tensors as input, a tuple
                        of the input tensors should be provided. It is assumed
                        that for all given input tensors, dimension 0 corresponds
                        to the number of examples, and if multiple input tensors
                        are provided, the examples must be aligned appropriately.
            additional_forward_args (any, optional): If the forward function
                        requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                        which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                        can be provided. It must be either a single additional
                        argument of a Tensor or arbitrary (non-tuple) type or a
                        tuple containing multiple additional arguments including
                        tensors or any arbitrary python types. These arguments
                        are provided to forward_func in order following the
                        arguments in inputs.
                        Note that attributions are not computed with respect
                        to these arguments.
                        Default: None
            attribute_to_layer_input (bool, optional): Indicates whether to
                        compute the attribution with respect to the layer input
                        or output. If `attribute_to_layer_input` is set to True
                        then the attributions will be computed with respect to
                        layer input, otherwise it will be computed with respect
                        to layer output.
                        Note that currently it is assumed that either the input
                        or the output of internal layer, depending on whether we
                        attribute to the input or output, is a single tensor.
                        Support for multiple tensors will be added later.
                        Default: False

        Returns:
            *tensor* or tuple of *tensors* or *list* of **attributions**:
            - **attributions** (*tensor* or tuple of *tensors* or *list*):
                        Activation of each neuron in given layer output.
                        Attributions will always be the same size as the
                        output of the given layer.
                        Attributions are returned in a tuple if
                        the layer inputs / outputs contain multiple tensors,
                        otherwise a single tensor is returned.
                        If multiple layers are provided, attributions
                        are returned as a list, each element corresponding to the
                        activations of the corresponding layer.
