class TCAV(ConceptInterpreter):

    This class implements ConceptInterpreter abstract class using an
    approach called Testing with Concept Activation Vectors (TCAVs),
    as described in the paper:
    https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.11279.pdf

    TCAV scores for a given layer, a list of concepts and input example
    are computed using the dot product between prediction's layer
    sensitivities for given input examples and Concept Activation Vectors
    (CAVs) in that same layer.

    CAVs are defined as vectors that are orthogonal to the classification boundary
    hyperplane that separate given concepts in a given layer from each other.
    For a given layer, CAVs are computed by training a classifier that uses the
    layer activation vectors for a set of concept examples as input examples and
    concept ids as corresponding input labels. Trained weights of
    that classifier represent CAVs.

    CAVs are represented as a learned weight matrix with the dimensionality
    C X F, where:
    F represents the number of input features in the classifier.
    C is the number of concepts used for the classification. Concept
    ids are used as labels for concept examples during the training.

    We can use any layer attribution algorithm to compute layer sensitivities
    of a model prediction.
    For example, the gradients of an output prediction w.r.t. the outputs of
    the layer.
    The CAVs and the Sensitivities (SENS) are used to compute the TCAV score:

    0. TCAV = CAV â€¢ SENS, a dot product between those two vectors

    The final TCAV score can be computed by aggregating the TCAV scores
    for each input concept based on the sign or magnitude of the tcav scores.

    1. sign_count_score = | TCAV > 0 | / | TCAV |
    2. magnitude_score = SUM(ABS(TCAV * (TCAV > 0))) / SUM(ABS(TCAV))

        This method computes magnitude and sign-based TCAV scores for each
        experimental sets in `experimental_sets` list.
        TCAV scores are computed using a dot product between layer attribution
        scores for specific predictions and CAV vectors.

        Args:
            inputs (tensor or tuple of tensors): Inputs for which predictions
                    are performed and attributions are computed.
                    If model takes a single tensor as
                    input, a single input tensor should be provided.
                    If model takes multiple tensors as
                    input, a tuple of the input tensors should be provided.
                    It is assumed that for all given input tensors,
                    dimension 0 corresponds to the number of examples
                    (aka batch size), and if multiple input tensors are
                    provided, the examples must be aligned appropriately.
            experimental_sets (list[list[Concept]]): A list of list of Concept
                    instances.
            target (int, tuple, tensor or list, optional):  Output indices for
                    which attributions are computed (for classification cases,
                    this is usually the target class).
                    If the network returns a scalar value per example,
                    no target index is necessary.
                    For general 2D outputs, targets can be either:

                    - a single integer or a tensor containing a single
                        integer, which is applied to all input examples
                    - a list of integers or a 1D tensor, with length matching
                        the number of examples in inputs (dim 0). Each integer
                        is applied as the target for the corresponding example.

                    For outputs with > 2 dimensions, targets can be either:

                    - A single tuple, which contains #output_dims - 1
                        elements. This target index is applied to all examples.
                    - A list of tuples with length equal to the number of
                        examples in inputs (dim 0), and each tuple containing
                        #output_dims - 1 elements. Each tuple is applied as the
                        target for the corresponding example.

            additional_forward_args (Any, optional): Extra arguments that are passed to
                     model when computing the attributions for `inputs`
                     w.r.t. layer output.
                     Default: None
            processes (int, optional): The number of processes to be created. if
                    processes is larger than one then CAV computations will be
                    performed in parallel using the number of processes equal to
                    `processes`. Otherwise, CAV computations will be performed
                    sequential.
                    Default:None
            **kwargs (Any, optional): A list of arguments that are passed to layer
                    attribution algorithm's attribute method. This could be for
                    example `n_steps` in case of integrated gradients.
                    Default: None
        Returns:
            results (dict): A dictionary of sign and magnitude -based tcav scores
                    for each concept set per layer.
                    The order of TCAV scores in the resulting tensor for each
                    experimental set follows the order in which concepts
                    are passed in `experimental_sets` input argument.

            >>> # scores =
            >>> # {'0-1':
