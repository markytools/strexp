class Concept:

    r"""
    Concepts are human-friendly abstract representations that can be
    numerically encoded into torch tensors. They can be illustrated as
    images, text or any other form of representation. In case of images,
    for example, "stripes" concept can be represented through a number
    of example images resembling "stripes" in various different
    contexts. In case of Natural Language Processing, the concept of
    "happy", for instance, can be illustrated through a number of
    adjectives and words that convey happiness.
