class Classifier(ABC):
    r"""
    An abstract class definition of any classifier that allows to train a model
    and access trained weights of that model.

    More specifically the classifier can, for instance, be trained on the
    activations of a particular layer. Below we can see an example a sklearn
    linear classifier wrapped by the `CustomClassifier` which extends `Classifier`
    abstract class.

    Example::

    >>> from sklearn import linear_model
    >>>
    >>> class CustomClassifier(Classifier):
    >>>
    >>> def __init__(self):
    >>>
    >>>     self.lm = linear_model.SGDClassifier(alpha=0.01, max_iter=1000,
    >>>                                          tol=1e-3)
    >>>
    >>> def train_and_eval(self, dataloader):
    >>>
    >>>     x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(inputs, labels)
    >>>     self.lm.fit(x_train.detach().numpy(), y_train.detach().numpy())
    >>>
    >>>     preds = torch.tensor(self.lm.predict(x_test.detach().numpy()))
    >>>     return {'accs': (preds == y_test).float().mean()}
    >>>
    >>>
    >>> def weights(self):
    >>>
    >>>     if len(self.lm.coef_) == 1:
    >>>         # if there are two concepts, there is only one label.
    >>>         # We split it in two.
    >>>         return torch.tensor([-1 * self.lm.coef_[0], self.lm.coef_[0]])
    >>>     else:
    >>>         return torch.tensor(self.lm.coef_)
    >>>
    >>>
    >>> def classes(self):
    >>>     return self.lm.classes_
    >>>
