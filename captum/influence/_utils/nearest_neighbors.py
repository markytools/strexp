class NearestNeighbors(ABC):
    r"""
    An abstract class to define a nearest neighbors data structure. Classes
    implementing this interface are intended for computing proponents / opponents in
    certain implementations of `TracInCPBase`. In particular, it is for use in
    implementations which compute proponents / opponents of a test instance by
    1) storing representations of training instances within a nearest neighbors data
    structure, and 2) finding within that structure the nearest neighbor of the
    representation of a test instance. The assumption is that the data structure
    stores the tensors passed to the `setup` method, which we refer to as the "stored
    tensors". If this class is used to find proponents / opponents, the nearest
    neighbors of a tensor should be the stored tensors that have the largest
    dot-product with the query.

        Given a `query`, a tensor of shape (N, *), returns the nearest neighbors in the
        "stored tensors" (see above). `query` represents a batch of N tensors, each
        of common but arbitrary shape *. We always assume the 0-th dimension indexes
        the batch. In use cases of this class for computing proponents / opponents,
        the nearest neighbors of a tensor should be the stored tensors with the largest
        dot-product with the tensor, and the tensors in `query` will all be 1D,
        so that `query` is 2D.

        Args:
            query (tensor): tensor representing the batch of tensors for which k-nearest
                    neighbors are desired. `query` is of shape (N, *), where N is the
                    size of the batch, i.e. the 0-th dimension of `query` indexes the
                    batch. * denotes an arbitrary shape, so that each tensor in the
                    batch can be of a common, but arbitrary shape.
            k (int): The number of nearest neighbors to return.

        Returns:
            results (tuple): A tuple of `(indices, distances)` is returned. `indices`
                    is a 2D tensor where `indices[i,j]` is the index (within the
                    "stored tensors" passed to the `setup` method) of the `j`-th
                    nearest neighbor of the `i`-th instance in query, and
                    `distances[i,j]` is the corresponding distance. `indices` should
                    be of dtype `torch.long` so that it can be used to index torch
                    tensors.

        we need to first store the stored tensors, by doing processing that indexes
        the stored tensors in a form that enables nearest-neighbors computation.
        This method does that preprocessing, and is assumed to be called before any

class AnnoyNearestNeighbors(NearestNeighbors):

    This is an implementation of `NearestNeighbors` that uses the Annoy module. At a
    high level, Annoy finds nearest neighbors by constructing binary trees in which
    vectors reside at leaf nodes. Vectors near each other will tend to be in the same
    leaf node. See https://tinyurl.com/2p89sb2h and https://github.com/spotify/annoy
    for more details. Annoy has 1 key parameter: the number of trees to construct.
    Increasing the number of trees leads to more accurate results, but longer time to
    create the trees and memory usage. As mentioned in the `NearestNeighbors`
    documentation, for the use case of computing proponents / opponents, the nearest
    neighbors returned should be those with the largest dot product with the query
    vector. The term "vector" is used here because Annoy stores 1D vectors. However
    in our wrapper around Annoy, we will allow the stored tensors to be of a common
    but arbitrary shape *, and flatten them before storing in the Annoy data structure.
