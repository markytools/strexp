Implements abstract DataInfluence class and provides implementation details for
influence computation based on the logic provided in TracIn paper
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08484.pdf).

The TracIn paper proposes an idealized notion of influence which can be represented by
the total amount a training example reduces loss for a test example via a training
process such as stochastic gradient descent. As this idealized notion of influence is
impractical to compute, the TracIn paper proposes instead to compute an influence
score, which uses a first-order approximation for the change in loss for a test example
by a training example, which is accumulated across saved model checkpoints. This
influence score is accumulated via a summed dot-product of gradient vectors for the
scores/loss of a test and training example.

"""
TODO: Support for checkpoint type. Currently only supports model parameters as saved
checkpoints. Can use enum or string.

Potential implementation from design doc:
checkpoint_type (Enum = [Parameters | Loss_Grad]): For performance,
                saved / loaded checkpoints can be either model parameters, or
                gradient of the loss function on an input w.r.t parameters.

    This namedtuple stores the results of using the `influence` method. This method
    is implemented by all subclasses of `TracInCPBase` to calculate
    proponents / opponents. The `indices` field stores the indices of the

    opponents, `indices[i][j]` stores the index in the training data of the example
    with the `j`-th highest influence score on the `i`-th example in the test batch.
    Similarly, the `influence_scores` field stores the actual influence scores, so that
    `influence_scores[i][j]` is the influence score of example `indices[i][j]` in the

            model (torch.nn.Module): An instance of pytorch model. This model should
                    define all of its layers as attributes of the model.
            influence_src_dataset (torch.utils.data.Dataset or torch.utils.DataLoader):
                    In the `influence` method, we either compute the influence score of
                    training examples on examples in a test batch, or self influence
                    scores for those training examples, depending on which mode is used.
                    This argument represents the training dataset containing those
                    training examples. In order to compute those influence scores, we
                    will create a Pytorch DataLoader yielding batches of training
                    examples that is then used for processing. If this argument is
                    already a Pytorch Dataloader, that DataLoader can be directly
                    used for processing. If it is instead a Pytorch Dataset, we will
                    create a DataLoader using it, with batch size specified by
                    `batch_size`. For efficiency purposes, the batch size of the
                    DataLoader used for processing should be as large as possible, but
                    not too large, so that certain intermediate quantities created
                    from a batch still fit in memory. Therefore, if
                    `influence_src_dataset` is a Dataset, `batch_size` should be large.
                    If `influence_src_dataset` was already a DataLoader to begin with,
                    it should have been constructed to have a large batch size.
            checkpoints (str or List of str or Iterator): Either the directory of the
                    path to store and retrieve model checkpoints, a list of
                    filepaths with checkpoints from which to load, or an iterator which
                    returns objects from which to load checkpoints.
            checkpoints_load_func (Callable, optional): The function to load a saved
                    checkpoint into a model to update its parameters, and get the
                    learning rate if it is saved. By default uses a utility to load a

                    gradients should be computed. If `layers` is None, gradients will
                    be computed for all layers. Otherwise, they will only be computed
                    for the layers specified in `layers`.
                    Default: None
            loss_fn (Callable, optional): The loss function applied to model.

                    intermediate quantities created from a batch still fit in memory.
                    Specific implementations of `TracInCPBase` will detail the size of

              `indices` is a 2D tensor of shape `(input_size, k)`, where
              `input_size` is the number of examples in the test batch. If

              index in training dataset `influence_src_dataset` of the example
              with the `j`-th highest (resp. lowest) influence score (out of the
              examples in `influence_src_dataset`) on the `i`-th example in the
              test batch. `influence_scores` contains the corresponding influence
              scores. In particular, `influence_scores[i][j]` is the influence
              score of example `indices[i][j]` in `influence_src_dataset` on
              example `i` in the test batch represented by `inputs` and

        Args:
            model (torch.nn.Module): An instance of pytorch model. This model should
                    define all of its layers as attributes of the model.
            influence_src_dataset (torch.utils.data.Dataset or torch.utils.DataLoader):
                    In the `influence` method, we either compute the influence score of
                    training examples on examples in a test batch, or self influence
                    scores for those training examples, depending on which mode is used.
                    This argument represents the training dataset containing those
                    training examples. In order to compute those influence scores, we
                    will create a Pytorch DataLoader yielding batches of training
                    examples that is then used for processing. If this argument is
                    already a Pytorch Dataloader, that DataLoader can be directly
                    used for processing. If it is instead a Pytorch Dataset, we will
                    create a DataLoader using it, with batch size specified by
                    `batch_size`. For efficiency purposes, the batch size of the
                    DataLoader used for processing should be as large as possible, but
                    not too large, so that certain intermediate quantities created
                    from a batch still fit in memory. Therefore, if
                    `influence_src_dataset` is a Dataset, `batch_size` should be large.
                    If `influence_src_dataset` was already a DataLoader to begin with,
                    it should have been constructed to have a large batch size.
            checkpoints (str or List of str or Iterator): Either the directory of the
                    path to store and retrieve model checkpoints, a list of
                    filepaths with checkpoints from which to load, or an iterator which
                    returns objects from which to load checkpoints.
            checkpoints_load_func (Callable, optional): The function to load a saved
                    checkpoint into a model to update its parameters, and get the
                    learning rate if it is saved. By default uses a utility to load a
                    model saved as a state dict.
                    Default: _load_flexible_state_dict
            layers (List of str or None, optional): A list of layer names for which
                    gradients should be computed. If `layers` is None, gradients will
                    be computed for all layers. Otherwise, they will only be computed
                    for the layers specified in `layers`.
                    Default: None
            loss_fn (Callable, optional): The loss function applied to model. There
                    are two options for the return type of `loss_fn`. First, `loss_fn`
                    can be a "per-example" loss function - returns a 1D Tensor of
                    losses for each example in a batch. `nn.BCELoss(reduction="none")`
                    would be an "per-example" loss function. Second, `loss_fn` can be
                    a "reduction" loss function that reduces the per-example losses,
                    in a batch, and returns a single scalar Tensor. For this option,
                    the reduction must be the *sum* or the *mean* of the per-example
                    losses. For instance, `nn.BCELoss(reduction="sum")` is acceptable.
                    Note for the first option, the `sample_wise_grads_per_batch`
                    argument must be False, and for the second option,
                    `sample_wise_grads_per_batch` must be True.  Also note that for
                    the second option, if `loss_fn` has no "reduction" attribute,
                    the implementation assumes that the reduction is the *sum* of the
                    per-example losses.  If this is not the case, i.e. the reduction
                    is the *mean*, please set the "reduction" attribute of `loss_fn`
                    to "mean", i.e. `loss_fn.reduction = "mean"`.
                    Default: None
            batch_size (int or None, optional): Batch size of the DataLoader created to
                    iterate through `influence_src_dataset`, if it is a Dataset.
                    `batch_size` should be chosen as large as possible so that certain
                    intermediate quantities created from a batch still fit in memory.
                    Specific implementations of `TracInCPBase` will detail the size of
                    the intermediate quantities. `batch_size` must be an int if
                    `influence_src_dataset` is a Dataset. If `influence_src_dataset`
                    is a DataLoader, then `batch_size` is ignored as an argument.
                    Default: 1
            sample_wise_grads_per_batch (bool, optional): PyTorch's native gradient
                    computations w.r.t. model parameters aggregates the results for a
                    batch and does not allow to access sample-wise gradients w.r.t.
                    model parameters. This forces us to iterate over each sample in
                    the batch if we want sample-wise gradients which is computationally
                    inefficient. We offer an implementation of batch-wise gradient
                    computations w.r.t. to model parameters which is computationally
                    more efficient. This implementation can be enabled by setting the
                    `sample_wise_grad_per_batch` argument to `True`, and should be
                    enabled if and only if the `loss_fn` argument is a "reduction" loss
                    function. For example, `nn.BCELoss(reduction="sum")` would be a
                    valid `loss_fn` if this implementation is enabled (see
                    documentation for `loss_fn` for more details). Note that our
                    current implementation enables batch-wise gradient computations
                    only for a limited number of PyTorch nn.Modules: Conv2D and Linear.
                    This list will be expanded in the near future.  Therefore, please
                    do not enable this implementation if gradients will be computed
                    for other kinds of layers.

        This is the key method of this class, and can be run in 3 different modes,
        where the mode that is run depends on the arguments passed to this method:

        - self influence mode: This mode is used if `inputs` is None. This mode
          computes the self influence scores for every example in
          the training dataset `influence_src_dataset`.
        - influence score mode: This mode is used if `inputs` is not None, and `k` is
          None. This mode computes the influence score of every example in
          training dataset `influence_src_dataset` on every example in the test
          batch represented by `inputs` and `targets`.
        - k-most influential mode: This mode is used if `inputs` is not None, and
          `k` is not None, and an int. This mode computes the proponents or
          opponents of every example in the test batch represented by `inputs`
          and `targets`. In particular, for each test example in the test batch,
          this mode computes its proponents (resp. opponents), which are the
          indices in the training dataset `influence_src_dataset` of the training
          examples with the `k` highest (resp. lowest) influence scores on the
          test example. Proponents are computed if `proponents` is True.
          Otherwise, opponents are computed. For each test example, this method
          also returns the actual influence score of each proponent (resp.
          opponent) on the test example.

        Args:
            inputs (Any, optional): If not provided or `None`, the self influence mode
                    will be run. Otherwise, `inputs` is the test batch that will be
                    used when running in either influence score or k-most influential
                    mode. If the argument `unpack_inputs` is False, the
                    assumption is that `self.model(inputs)` produces the predictions
                    for a batch, and `inputs` can be of any type. Otherwise if the
                    argument `unpack_inputs` is True, the assumption is that
                    `self.model(*inputs)` produces the predictions for a batch, and
                    `inputs` will need to be a tuple. In other words, `inputs` will be
                    unpacked as an argument when passing to `self.model`.
                    Default: None
            targets (tensor, optional): If computing influence scores on a loss
                    function, these are the labels corresponding to the batch `inputs`.
                    Default: None
            k (int, optional): If not provided or `None`, the influence score mode will
                    be run. Otherwise, the k-most influential mode will be run,
                    and `k` is the number of proponents / opponents to return per
                    example in the test batch.
                    Default: None
            proponents (bool, optional): Whether seeking proponents (`proponents=True`)
                    or opponents (`proponents=False`), if running in k-most influential
                    mode.
                    Default: True
            unpack_inputs (bool, optional): Whether to unpack the `inputs` argument to
                    when passing it to `model`, if `inputs` is a tuple (no unpacking
                    done otherwise).
                    Default: True
            show_progress (bool, optional): For all modes, computation of results
                    requires "training dataset computations": computations for each
                    batch in the training dataset `influence_src_dataset`, which may
                    take a long time. If `show_progress`is true, the progress of
                    "training dataset computations" will be displayed. In particular,
                    the number of batches for which computations have been performed
                    will be displayed. It will try to use tqdm if available for
                    advanced features (e.g. time estimation). Otherwise, it will
                    fallback to a simple output of progress.
                    Default: False

        Returns:
            The return value of this method depends on which mode is run.

            - self influence mode: if this mode is run (`inputs` is None), returns a 1D
              tensor of self influence scores over training dataset
              `influence_src_dataset`. The length of this tensor is the number of
              examples in `influence_src_dataset`, regardless of whether it is a
              Dataset or DataLoader.
            - influence score mode: if this mode is run (`inputs is not None, `k` is
              None), returns a 2D tensor `influence_scores` of shape
              `(input_size, influence_src_dataset_size)`, where `input_size` is
              the number of examples in the test batch, and
              `influence_src_dataset_size` is the number of examples in
              training dataset `influence_src_dataset`. In other words,
              `influence_scores[i][j]` is the influence score of the `j`-th
              example in `influence_src_dataset` on the `i`-th example in the
              test batch.
