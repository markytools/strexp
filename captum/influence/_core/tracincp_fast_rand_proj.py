Implements abstract DataInfluence class and also provides implementation details for
influence computation based on the logic provided in TracIn paper
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08484.pdf).

The TracIn paper proposes an idealized notion of influence which can be represented by
the total amount a training example reduces loss for a test example via a training
process such as stochastic gradient descent. As this idealized notion of influence is
impractical to compute, the TracIn paper proposes instead to compute an influence
score, which uses a first-order approximation for the change in loss for a test example
by a training example, which is accumulated across saved model checkpoints. This
influence score is accumulated via a summed dot-product of gradient vectors for the
scores/loss of a test and training example.

"""
TODO: Support for checkpoint type. Currently only supports model parameters as saved
checkpoints. Can use enum or string.

Potential implementation from design doc:
checkpoint_type (Enum = [Parameters | Loss_Grad]): For performance,
                saved / loaded checkpoints can be either model parameters, or
                gradient of the loss function on an input w.r.t parameters.

    In Appendix F, Page 14 of the TracIn paper, they show that the calculation
    of the influence score of between a test example x' and a training example x,
    can be computed much more quickly than naive back-propagation in the special
    case when considering only gradients in the last fully-connected layer. This class
    computes influence scores for that special case. Note that the computed
    influence scores are exactly the same as when naive back-propagation is used -
    there is no loss in accuracy.

        Args:
            model (torch.nn.Module): An instance of pytorch model. This model should
                    define all of its layers as attributes of the model.
            final_fc_layer (torch.nn.Module or str): The last fully connected layer in
                    the network for which gradients will be approximated via fast random
                    projection method. Can be either the layer module itself, or the
                    fully qualified name of the layer if it is a defined attribute of
                    the passed `model`.
            influence_src_dataset (torch.utils.data.Dataset or torch.utils.DataLoader):
                    In the `influence` method, we either compute the influence score of
                    training examples on examples in a test batch, or self influence
                    scores for those training examples, depending on which mode is used.
                    This argument represents the training dataset containing those
                    training examples. In order to compute those influence scores, we
                    will create a Pytorch DataLoader yielding batches of training
                    examples that is then used for processing. If this argument is
                    already a Pytorch Dataloader, that DataLoader can be directly
                    used for processing. If it is instead a Pytorch Dataset, we will
                    create a DataLoader using it, with batch size specified by
                    `batch_size`. For efficiency purposes, the batch size of the
                    DataLoader used for processing should be as large as possible, but
                    not too large, so that certain intermediate quantities created
                    from a batch still fit in memory. Therefore, if
                    `influence_src_dataset` is a Dataset, `batch_size` should be large.
                    If `influence_src_dataset` was already a DataLoader to begin with,
                    it should have been constructed to have a large batch size.
            checkpoints (str or List of str or Iterator): Either the directory of the
                    path to store and retrieve model checkpoints, a list of
                    filepaths with checkpoints from which to load, or an iterator which
                    returns objects from which to load checkpoints.
            checkpoints_load_func (Callable, optional): The function to load a saved
                    checkpoint into a model to update its parameters, and get the
                    learning rate if it is saved. By default uses a utility to load a
                    model saved as a state dict.
                    Default: _load_flexible_state_dict
            loss_fn (Callable, optional): The loss function applied to model. `loss_fn`
                    must be a "reduction" loss function that reduces the per-example
                    losses in a batch, and returns a single scalar Tensor. Furthermore,
                    the reduction must be the *sum* or the *mean* of the per-example
                    losses. For instance, `nn.BCELoss(reduction="sum")` is acceptable.
                    Also note that if `loss_fn` has no "reduction" attribute,
                    the implementation assumes that the reduction is the *sum* of the
                    per-example losses.  If this is not the case, i.e. the reduction
                    is the *mean*, please set the "reduction" attribute of `loss_fn`
                    to "mean", i.e. `loss_fn.reduction = "mean"`.
                    Default: None
            batch_size (int or None, optional): Batch size of the DataLoader created to

                    `batch_size` should be chosen as large as possible so that certain
                    intermediate quantities created from a batch still fit in memory.
                    Specific implementations of `TracInCPBase` will detail the size of
                    the intermediate quantities. `batch_size` must be an int if
                    `influence_src_dataset` is a Dataset. If `influence_src_dataset`
                    is a DataLoader, then `batch_size` is ignored as an argument.
                    Default: 1

        This is the key method of this class, and can be run in 3 different modes,
        where the mode that is run depends on the arguments passed to this method:

        - self influence mode: This mode is used if `inputs` is None. This mode
          computes the self influence scores for every example in
          the training dataset `influence_src_dataset`.
        - influence score mode: This mode is used if `inputs` is not None, and `k` is
          None. This mode computes the influence score of every example in
          training dataset `influence_src_dataset` on every example in the test
          batch represented by `inputs` and `targets`.
        - k-most influential mode: This mode is used if `inputs` is not None, and
          `k` is not None, and an int. This mode computes the proponents or
          opponents of every example in the test batch represented by `inputs`
          and `targets`. In particular, for each test example in the test batch,
          this mode computes its proponents (resp. opponents), which are the
          indices in the training dataset `influence_src_dataset` of the training
          examples with the `k` highest (resp. lowest) influence scores on the
          test example. Proponents are computed if `proponents` is True.
          Otherwise, opponents are computed. For each test example, this method
          also returns the actual influence score of each proponent (resp.
          opponent) on the test example.

        Args:
            inputs (Any, optional): If not provided or `None`, the self influence mode
                    will be run. Otherwise, `inputs` is the test batch that will be
                    used when running in either influence score or k-most influential
                    mode. If the argument `unpack_inputs` is False, the
                    assumption is that `self.model(inputs)` produces the predictions
                    for a batch, and `inputs` can be of any type. Otherwise if the
                    argument `unpack_inputs` is True, the assumption is that
                    `self.model(*inputs)` produces the predictions for a batch, and
                    `inputs` will need to be a tuple. In other words, `inputs` will be
                    unpacked as an argument when passing to `self.model`.
                    Default: None
            targets (tensor, optional): The labels corresponding to the batch `inputs`.
                    This method is designed to be applied for a loss function, so
                    `targets` is required, unless running in "self influence" mode.
                    Default: None
            k (int, optional): If not provided or `None`, the influence score mode will
                    be run. Otherwise, the k-most influential mode will be run,
                    and `k` is the number of proponents / opponents to return per
                    example in the test batch.
                    Default: None
            proponents (bool, optional): Whether seeking proponents (`proponents=True`)
                    or opponents (`proponents=False`), if running in k-most influential
                    mode.
                    Default: True
            unpack_inputs (bool, optional): Whether to unpack the `inputs` argument to
                    when passing it to `model`, if `inputs` is a tuple (no unpacking
                    done otherwise).
                    Default: True
            show_progress (bool, optional): For all modes, computation of results
                    requires "training dataset computations": computations for each
                    batch in the training dataset `influence_src_dataset`, which may
                    take a long time. If `show_progress`is true, the progress of
                    "training dataset computations" will be displayed. In particular,
                    the number of batches for which computations have been performed
                    will be displayed. It will try to use tqdm if available for
                    advanced features (e.g. time estimation). Otherwise, it will
                    fallback to a simple output of progress.
                    Default: False

        Returns:
            The return value of this method depends on which mode is run.

            - self influence mode: if this mode is run (`inputs` is None), returns a 1D
              tensor of self influence scores over training dataset
              `influence_src_dataset`. The length of this tensor is the number of
              examples in `influence_src_dataset`, regardless of whether it is a
              Dataset or DataLoader.
            - influence score mode: if this mode is run (`inputs is not None, `k` is
              None), returns a 2D tensor `influence_scores` of shape
              `(input_size, influence_src_dataset_size)`, where `input_size` is
              the number of examples in the test batch, and
              `influence_src_dataset_size` is the number of examples in
              training dataset `influence_src_dataset`. In other words,
              `influence_scores[i][j]` is the influence score of the `j`-th
              example in `influence_src_dataset` on the `i`-th example in the
              test batch.
            - k-most influential mode: if this mode is run (`inputs` is not None,
              `k` is an int), returns a namedtuple `(indices, influence_scores)`.
              `indices` is a 2D tensor of shape `(input_size, k)`, where
              `input_size` is the number of examples in the test batch. If
              computing proponents (resp. opponents), `indices[i][j]` is the
              index in training dataset `influence_src_dataset` of the example
              with the `j`-th highest (resp. lowest) influence score (out of the
              examples in `influence_src_dataset`) on the `i`-th example in the
              test batch. `influence_scores` contains the corresponding influence
              scores. In particular, `influence_scores[i][j]` is the influence
              score of example `indices[i][j]` in `influence_src_dataset` on
              example `i` in the test batch represented by `inputs` and

        A version of TracInCPFast which is optimized for "interactive" calls to
        `influence` for the purpose of calculating proponents / opponents, or
        influence scores. "Interactive" means there will be multiple calls to
        `influence`, with each call for a different batch of test examples, and
        subsequent calls rely on the results of previous calls. The implementation in
        this class has been optimized so that each call to `influence` is fast, so that
        it can be used for interactive analysis. This class should only be used for
        interactive use cases. It should not be used if `influence` will only be
        called once, because to enable fast calls to `influence`, time and memory
        intensive preprocessing is required in `__init__`. Furthermore, it should not
        be used to calculate self influencs scores - `TracInCPFast` should be used
        instead for that purpose. To enable interactive analysis, this implementation
        saves pre-computed vectors for all training examples in
        `influence_src_dataset`. Crucially, the influence score of a training
        example on a test example is simply the dot-product of their corresponding
        vectors, and proponents / opponents can be found by first storing vectors for
        training examples in a nearest-neighbor data structure, and then finding the
        nearest-neighbors for a test example in terms of dot-product (see appendix F
        of the TracIn paper). This class should only be used if calls to `influence`
        to obtain proponents / opponents or influence scores will be made in an
        "interactive" manner, and there is sufficient memory to store vectors for the
        entire `influence_src_dataset`. This is because in order to enable interactive
        analysis, this implementation incures overhead in ``__init__` to setup the
        nearest-neighbors data structure, which is both time and memory intensive, as
        vectors corresponding to all training examples needed to be stored. To reduce
        memory usage, this implementation enables random projections of those vectors.
        Note that the influence scores computed with random projections are less
        accurate, though correct in expectation.

        Args:
            model (torch.nn.Module): An instance of pytorch model. This model should
                    define all of its layers as attributes of the model.
            final_fc_layer (torch.nn.Module or str): The last fully connected layer in
                    the network for which gradients will be approximated via fast random
                    projection method. Can be either the layer module itself, or the
                    fully qualified name of the layer if it is a defined attribute of
                    the passed `model`.
            influence_src_dataset (torch.utils.data.Dataset or torch.utils.DataLoader):
                    In the `influence` method, we either compute the influence score of
                    training examples on examples in a test batch, or self influence
                    scores for those training examples, depending on which mode is used.
                    This argument represents the training dataset containing those
                    training examples. In order to compute those influence scores, we
                    will create a Pytorch DataLoader yielding batches of training
                    examples that is then used for processing. If this argument is
                    already a Pytorch Dataloader, that DataLoader can be directly
                    used for processing. If it is instead a Pytorch Dataset, we will
                    create a DataLoader using it, with batch size specified by
                    `batch_size`. For efficiency purposes, the batch size of the
                    DataLoader used for processing should be as large as possible, but
                    not too large, so that certain intermediate quantities created
                    from a batch still fit in memory. Therefore, if
                    `influence_src_dataset` is a Dataset, `batch_size` should be large.
                    If `influence_src_dataset` was already a DataLoader to begin with,
                    it should have been constructed to have a large batch size.
            checkpoints (str or List of str or Iterator): Either the directory of the
                    path to store and retrieve model checkpoints, a list of
                    filepaths with checkpoints from which to load, or an iterator which
                    returns objects from which to load checkpoints.
            checkpoints_load_func (Callable, optional): The function to load a saved
                    checkpoint into a model to update its parameters, and get the
                    learning rate if it is saved. By default uses a utility to load a
                    model saved as a state dict.
                    Default: _load_flexible_state_dict
            loss_fn (Callable, optional): The loss function applied to model. `loss_fn`
                    must be a "reduction" loss function that reduces the per-example
                    losses in a batch, and returns a single scalar Tensor. Furthermore,
                    the reduction must be the *sum* of the per-example losses. For
                    instance, `nn.BCELoss(reduction="sum")` is acceptable, but
                    `nn.BCELoss(reduction="mean")` is *not* acceptable.
                    Default: None
            batch_size (int or None, optional): Batch size of the DataLoader created to
                    iterate through `influence_src_dataset`, if it is a Dataset.
                    `batch_size` should be chosen as large as possible so that certain
                    intermediate quantities created from a batch still fit in memory.
                    Specific implementations of `TracInCPBase` will detail the size of
                    the intermediate quantities. `batch_size` must be an int if
                    `influence_src_dataset` is a Dataset. If `influence_src_dataset`
                    is a DataLoader, then `batch_size` is ignored as an argument.
                    Default: 1
            vectorize (bool): Flag to use experimental vectorize functionality
                    for `torch.autograd.functional.jacobian`.
                    Default: False
            nearest_neighbors (NearestNeighbors, optional): The NearestNeighbors
                    instance for finding nearest neighbors. If None, defaults to
                    `AnnoyNearestNeighbors(n_trees=10)`.
                    Default: None
            projection_dim (int, optional): Each example will be represented in
                    the nearest neighbors data structure with a vector. This vector
                    is the concatenation of several "checkpoint vectors", each of which
                    is computed using a different checkpoint in the `checkpoints`
                    argument. If `projection_dim` is an int, it represents the
                    dimension we will project each "checkpoint vector" to, so that the
                    vector for each example will be of dimension at most
                    `projection_dim` * C, where C is the number of checkpoints.
                    Regarding the dimension of each vector, D: Let I be the dimension
                    of the output of the last fully-connected layer times the dimension
                    of the input of the last fully-connected layer. If `projection_dim`
                    is not `None`, then D = min(I * C, `projection_dim` * C).
                    Otherwise, D = I * C. In summary, if `projection_dim` is None, the
                    dimension of this vector will be determined by the size of the
                    input and output of the last fully-connected layer of `model`, and
                    the number of checkpoints. Otherwise, `projection_dim` must be an
                    int, and random projection will be performed to ensure that the
                    vector is of dimension no more than `projection_dim` * C.
                    `projection_dim` corresponds to the variable d in the top of page
                    15 of the TracIn paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08484.pdf.
                    Default: None
            seed (int, optional): Because this implementation chooses a random
                    projection, its output is random. Setting this seed specifies the
                    random seed when choosing the random projection.

        This is the key method of this class, and can be run in 2 different modes,
        where the mode that is run depends on the arguments passed to this method

        - influence score mode: This mode is used if `inputs` is not None, and `k` is
          None. This mode computes the influence score of every example in
          training dataset `influence_src_dataset` on every example in the test
          batch represented by `inputs` and `targets`.

        - k-most influential mode: This mode is used if `inputs` is not None, and
          `k` is not None, and an int. This mode computes the proponents or
          opponents of every example in the test batch represented by `inputs`
          and `targets`. In particular, for each test example in the test batch,
          this mode computes its proponents (resp. opponents), which are the
          indices in the training dataset `influence_src_dataset` of the training
          examples with the `k` highest (resp. lowest) influence scores on the
          test example. Proponents are computed if `proponents` is True.
          Otherwise, opponents are computed. For each test example, this method
          also returns the actual influence score of each proponent (resp.
          opponent) on the test example.

        Note that unlike `TracInCPFast`, this class should *not* be run in self
        influence mode.  To compute self influence scores when only considering
        gradients in the last fully-connected layer, please use `TracInCPFast` instead.

        Args:
            inputs (Any, optional): If not provided or `None`, the self influence mode
                    will be run. Otherwise, `inputs` is the test batch that will be
                    used when running in either influence score or k-most influential
                    mode. If the argument `unpack_inputs` is False, the
                    assumption is that `self.model(inputs)` produces the predictions
                    for a batch, and `inputs` can be of any type. Otherwise if the
                    argument `unpack_inputs` is True, the assumption is that
                    `self.model(*inputs)` produces the predictions for a batch, and
                    `inputs` will need to be a tuple. In other words, `inputs` will be
                    unpacked as an argument when passing to `self.model`.

                    method is designed to be applied for a loss function, so `targets`
                    is required.
            k (int, optional): If not provided or `None`, the influence score mode will
                    be run. Otherwise, the k-most influential mode will be run,
                    and `k` is the number of proponents / opponents to return per
                    example in the test batch.
                    Default: None
            proponents (bool, optional): Whether seeking proponents (`proponents=True`)
                    or opponents (`proponents=False`), if running in k-most influential
                    mode.

            unpack_inputs (bool, optional): Whether to unpack the `inputs` argument to
                    when passing it to `model`, if `inputs` is a tuple (no unpacking
                    done otherwise).

              `indices` is a 2D tensor of shape `(input_size, k)`, where
              `input_size` is the number of examples in the test batch. If

              test batch. `influence_scores` contains the corresponding influence
              scores. In particular, `influence_scores[i][j]` is the influence

        on a given test example can be found using a nearest-neighbor (more
        specifically, largest dot-product) data structure.

        Args:
            dataloader (DataLoader): DataLoader for which the intermediate quantities
                    are computed.
            projection_quantities (tuple or None): Is either the two tensors defining
                    the randomized projections to apply, or None, which means no
                    projection is to be applied.

        Returns:
            checkpoint_projections (tensor): A tensor of dimension
                    (N, D * C), where N is total number of examples in `dataloader`, C
                    is the number of checkpoints passed as the `checkpoints` argument
                    of `TracInCPFastRandProj.__init__`, and each row represents the
                    vector for an example. Regarding D: Let I be the dimension of the
                    output of the last fully-connected layer times the dimension of the
                    input of the last fully-connected layer. If `self.projection_dim`
                    is specified in initialization,
                    D = min(I * C, `self.projection_dim` * C). Otherwise, D = I * C.
                    In summary, if `self.projection_dim` is None, the dimension of each
                    vector will be determined by the size of the input and output of
                    the last fully-connected layer of `model`. Otherwise,
                    `self.projection_dim` must be an int, and random projection will be
                    performed to ensure that the vector is of dimension no more than
                    `self.projection_dim` * C. `self.projection_dim` corresponds to
                    the variable d in the top of page 15 of the TracIn paper:
